🔥 BINXTHINXX WEBSITE BRIEF — CREATIVE INSTRUCTIONS
Brand tone:
 Poetic, emotionally intelligent, bold. Not pastel, not overly “feminine wellness.” This site should feel like truth after a long performance. The energy is reclamation, depth, intimacy, and clarity.

 Colors to anchor the design:
●	Ink blue (#0F1B2B) – grounding / headers

●	Burnt orange (#D86F38) – CTA and emotional pop

●	Candlelight beige (#F4EBDD) – background / content areas
 Optional accents: forest green or faded rust (used sparingly).

2. About Page – “The Mirror”
Purpose: Build trust by reflecting shared experience and showing credibility.
Include:
●	My story written narratively—not a resume. This should speak to being high-functioning, exhausted, craving self-belonging. (I have to write this myself so let me know when needed) 

●	Emotional pacing: survival → burnout → realization → self-reclamation.

●	List my credentials/experience briefly, but focus on why I do this work. (I’ll write this too)

●	My unique approach: trauma-informed, identity-first, shadow work, coaching for self-trust. Reparenting. 

●	CTA: “See how we can work together” or “Explore the process.”
